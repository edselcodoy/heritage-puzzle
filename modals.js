<b>Sinulog Festival</b> is an annual cultural and religious festival held on the third Sunday of January in <b>Cebu City</b>, Philippines. It is the center of the Santo Ni침o Catholic Christian celebrations in the country. The festival is considered to be the biggest festival in the Philippines, with every celebration of the festival routinely attracting between 1 million and 1.5 million people each year.

The word "Sinulog" comes from the Cebuano word "sulog", which means "current" or "flow". The dance ritual performed during the festival is a re-enactment of the graceful movements of the "sulog" of the Pasig River. The dance is also a way of the people of Cebu to express their joy and gratitude for the gift of the Santo Ni침o.

The <b>Sinulog Festival</b> has its roots in the pre-colonial period, when the people of Cebu were animists. The festival was originally a way of honoring the gods of nature. When the Spanish arrived in the Philippines in the 16th century, they brought with them Christianity.

The <b>Sinulog Festival</b> is a result of this blending of cultures.
